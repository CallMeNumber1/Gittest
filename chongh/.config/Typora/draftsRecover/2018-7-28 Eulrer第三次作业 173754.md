### Euler 43 (全排列函数)

- 头文件：#include <algorithm> 命名空间std

- C++中与排列有关的函数有两个:

		a) prev_permutation 求一个序列的前一个排列

		b) next_permutation

- 用法： 

  ```c
      int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
      do {
          for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
              printf("%d ", arr[i]);
          }
          printf("\n");
      } while (next_permutation(arr, arr+4)); 
  ```

  

- 题目：

  The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

  Let *d*1 be the 1st digit, *d*2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

  - *d*2*d*3*d*4=406 is divisible by 2
  - *d*3*d*4*d*5=063 is divisible by 3
  - *d*4*d*5*d*6=635 is divisible by 5
  - *d*5*d*6*d*7=357 is divisible by 7
  - *d*6*d*7*d*8=572 is divisible by 11
  - *d*7*d*8*d*9=728 is divisible by 13
  - *d*8*d*9*d*10=289 is divisible by 17

  Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

- 代码

  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <algorithm>
  #include <inttypes.h>
  using namespace std;
  int64_t isInteresting(int *a) {
      if (a[0] == 0) return 0;
      int p[7] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17};
      int j = 0;
      int64_t num = a[0], ret = a[0];
      for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
          ret = ret * 10 + a[i];
          num = num * 10 + a[i];
          if (i < 3) continue;
          num -= 1000 * a[i - 3];
          if (num % p[j++]) return 0;
      }
      return ret;
  }
  int main() {
      int a[10] = {0};
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
          a[i] = i;   
      }
      int64_t sum = 0, temp = 0;
      do {
          sum += isInteresting(a);
      } while (next_permutation(a, a + 10));
      printf("%"PRId64"\n", sum);
  }
  ```

  

  - 思路：

  isInteresting函数中，ret用来存储此数，num用来模拟连续的三位数。代码10-15行运用了滑动窗口法的思想，每向后移动一次，就将后面一位乘进去，将之前的一位除去，此处14行即为逆运算，（为了避免除0的错误，也用了乘积的方式）。

  代码25-27行即求出所有全排列。

### Euler 37  （数字位数处理）

- 题目：

  The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

  Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

  NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

- 解题关键

  ```c
      h = (int32_t)pow(10, floor(log10(n)));
      x = n;
      while (x) {
          x -= (x / h) * h;
          h /= 10;
      }
  ```

  

  依次去掉数字n的最高位。第1行即求得数字n十进制表示的最高位权。

### Euler 33 除法判断转乘法

- 题目

  The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

  We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

  There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

  If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

  判断两个分数相等，转换成乘法式子进行判断，是编程中常用的技巧。

### Euler 35 整数循环右移

- 题目

  The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

  There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

  How many circular primes are there below one million?
